It Consists of two Internship Projects 
1. Sales Data Analysis Using Excel : The main goal of this project is to identify patterns, best-selling items, and revenue indicators to aid in business decision-making. In this project, I have accomplished the following tasks: (A) Calculated total sales. (B) Analyzed sales trends over time. (C) Determined the best-selling products and created visualizations.
2. HR Data Analysis Using Python : In a comprehensive HR Data Analysis project focusing on Employee Attrition, I meticulously tackled various stages of data processing and analysis to unveil critical insights. Beginning with meticulous data pre-processing to ensure accuracy, I delved into Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), segmenting it into three key dimensions: the target variable, social impacts, and work impacts. Through visualizations and statistical techniques, I uncovered correlations within the data via a correlation matrix, shedding light on factors influencing employee attrition. The project's findings not only provide actionable insights for HR decision-makers but also contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics driving employee retention and turnover.
